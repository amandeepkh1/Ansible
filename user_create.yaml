#Write an Ansible playbook that creates a new user on the remote host and sets up SSH keys for that user.

#Make sure to replace remote_host with the actual hostname or IP address of your remote server, and adjust the paths to your SSH keys accordingly. 
#This playbook will create the user, create the .ssh directory, and upload the SSH key for the new use

#path: Specifies the path where the key files will be saved.
#type: Specifies the key type (e.g., rsa, ed25519, etc.).
#size: Specifies the key size (e.g., 2048, 4096, etc.).
#state: Set to present to ensure the keypair is generated
#The createhome: yes option ensures that the userâ€™s home directory is created.
#The openssh_keypair module generates an RSA keypair for the specified user.
